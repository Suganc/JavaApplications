Eggs can also be used in baking to produce savoury or sweet dishes.
 In combination with dairy products especially cheese, they are often prepared as a dessert.
  For example, although a baked custard can be made using starch (in the form of flour, cornflour, arrowroot, or potato flour), 
the flavor of the dish is much more delicate if eggs are used as the thickening agent.
