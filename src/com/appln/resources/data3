Hiking Nepal's Annapurna Circuit is one of the most stunningly beautiful, life-changing experiences you can have on your travels, and we're pretty sure that, 
like us, you'll be absolutely captivated by the area from the very first day.
Winding through some of the world's tallest mountains and diverse climatic zones (from tropical to freezing alpine peaks), 
intensive days spent on your feet, and enjoying the beautiful hospitality of the Nepalese people and their quaint mountain villages: the 16 days you'll spend on the Annapurna Circuit trail are some of the most inspiring and challenging you'll ever encounter, and the arrival back to Pokhara will feel so rewarding.
