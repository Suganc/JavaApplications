Children of the land do you hear?
Echoes of truth that once rang clear
Two souls intertwined, one true love they did bind
Bringing Light, and Heaven near
But flames that once burned bright, soon fell dark
Memories dimmed by shattered hearts
In the waxing gloom, did wane the lover's moon
Watching as their worlds drift apart
